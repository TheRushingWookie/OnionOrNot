OnionOrNot is a simple web game that checks how well you can tell the difference between satire and real life stories.

It uses a scraping of the subreddits nottheonion and NewsOfTheStupid to find articles that seem like they should be in the onion. It uses flask for a web server.

To get the onion articles, it uses feedburner.

It is setup as a heroku app
